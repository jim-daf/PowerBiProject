# UniversityProject_PowerBI

This university project is about retrieving data from my chess profile in chess.com and visualizing them in power bi.
I also retrieve nba team and player data, visualize them in Power Bi and according to these data i make some predictions such as:

1) Who will be the NBA champions of 2023
2) Who will be the regular season MVP
3) Who will be the Defensive player of the year
